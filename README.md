# gpytGPE
Univariate Gaussian process emulator (GPE) implementation around GPyTorch (gpyt) Gaussian process base class.

This library contains the tools needed for constructing a univariate Gaussian process emulator (GPE) as a surrogate model of a generic map X -> y. The map (e.g. a computer code input/output) is simply described by the (NxD) X matrix of input parameters and the respective (Nx1) y vector of one output feature, both provided by the user. GPEs are implemented as the sum of a mean function given by a linear regression model (with first-order degreed polynomials) and a centered (zero-mean) Gaussian process regressor with RBF kernel as covariance function. The GPE training can be performed either against a validation set (by validation loss) or by itself (by training loss), and it is performed using K-fold cross-validation (default is K=5). Available metrics are corrected MAPE (cMAPE), MSE and R2score. It is possible to switch between GPE's noise-free and noisy implementations. It is also possible to standardize the data before the training. The entire code runs on both CPU and GPU. The cross-validation training loop is implemented to run in parallel with multiprocessing.
